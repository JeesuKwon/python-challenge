# python-challenge
(Background)
It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

# PyBank Challenge
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Given dataset is composed of two columns : "Date" and "Profit/Losses"

Create Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll Challenge
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
The dataset is composed of 3 columes : "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate"

Create Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
